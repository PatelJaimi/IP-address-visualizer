            is a notation for describing blocks of IP addresses and is used heavily in various networking configurations. 
            IP addresses contain 4 octets, each consisting of 8 bits giving values between 0 and 255. 
            The decimal value that comes after the slash is the number of bits consisting of the routing prefix. 
            This in turn can be translated into a netmask, 
            and also designates how many available addresses are in the block.
